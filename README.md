# Movie Review Application

## Documentation
### Usage
You can browse movies and read user reviews. You can create your own account to write your own reviews.

### Materials
The application is built on the Express framework. I used postgres for persistence with the help of Sequelize. The app consumes data from both themoviedb API and a custom API written using Express as well. The custom API is used for user data and caching movie data.
